# Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models for Uncertain Probabilities
## Introduction
This repository contains the code of the numerical example that are disussed in the paper Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models for Uncertain Probabilities. The examples that are illustrated are single-item/multi-item newsvendor problems and a robust portfolio optimization problem. The main codes of each numerical example can be find in its corresponding ipynb file.
